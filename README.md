# House Boat Management System - Read Me

## Overview
Welcome to the House Boat Management System! This project entails the design and implementation of a Database Management System (DBMS) tailored for managing house boats. 

## Project Description
In this project, I have meticulously crafted an Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram to outline the structure and relationships within the system. Additionally, I've translated this conceptual design into a concrete implementation using SQL, incorporating all necessary constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.

## Contents
- **PDF Documentation**: A comprehensive PDF document has been created to encapsulate all the essential details of the project. This includes:
    - Detailed explanation of the project scope and objectives.
    - E-R diagram illustrating the entities and their relationships.
    - SQL commands utilized in the implementation.
    - Description of tables and their attributes.
    - Relationship definitions.
    - Constraints applied to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

## How to Use
To utilize this House Boat Management System, follow these steps:
1. Review the PDF documentation to gain an understanding of the system architecture, data model, and implemented functionalities.
2. Familiarize yourself with the SQL commands provided to interact with the database.
3. Execute the SQL commands in your preferred database management tool to set up and manage the system.
